# Bilevel message-passing for flow network optimization
This repository contains codes for algorithms developed in the work *"Bilevel Optimization in Flow Networks â€“ A Message-passing Approach"* by Bo Li, David Saad and Chi Ho Yeung, Phys. Rev. E 106, L042301 (2022).

The codes are written in Julia. It was last tested on Julia v1.7.3 and JuMP v1.1.0.

## Usage
For each problem, set the corresponding folder as the working directory, and run the Main program inside the folder.

## Remark
The codes are not optimized for best performance.
